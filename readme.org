* Book Club
  This is the repository for the uocsclub book club. Here you can find
  a compilation of the code I've written for the book club, as well as
  all the notes that I've written about what we've read. 

  We're currently reading "Programming Erlang: Software for a
  Concurrent World." by Joe Armstrong. You could even read [[./notes.pdf][the notes]]
  as a standalone reference on large parts of erlang.

  Come hang out for book club on the [[https://discord.gg/WAGf8cQ37Y][discord server]] on Friday nights
  at 7pm.
